### Project Description
Normal clocks spin clockwise in a loop, 
to break this loop we tried to make a clock that spins anticlockwise which does nothing.
Hence Useless!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Since the origin mankind have moved forward a lot, but nobody tried to move backwards.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
we took an initiative to turn the clock backwards.
